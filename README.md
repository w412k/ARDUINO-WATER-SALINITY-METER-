# SALINITY_METER
 SalinityMeterArduinoLCD  This repository contains the code and schematics for a salinity meter built using a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and an LCD display.  The project aims to provide a simple and cost-effective solution for measuring the salinity levels in water. The TDS sensor is utilized to detect the concentration of dissolved salts in the liquid, while the Arduino board processes the sensor data and displays the readings on an LCD screen.  Key Features:  Accurate measurement of salinity levels using a TDS sensor Arduino-based control and data processing Clear and easy-to-read display of salinity readings on an LCD screen This project serves as a foundation for water quality monitoring systems, aquarium management, hydroponics, and other applications where salinity measurement is crucial. The code and schematics provided can be easily customized and expanded upon to suit specific needs.  Get started with salinity measurement using the TDS sensor and Arduino by cloning this repository and following the provided documentation.

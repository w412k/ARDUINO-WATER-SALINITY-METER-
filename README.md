# SALINITY_METER

## Overview

The SALINITY_METER repository contains the code and schematics for a salinity meter built using a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and an LCD display. This project provides a simple and cost-effective solution for measuring salinity levels in water.

## Key Features

- Accurate measurement of salinity levels using a TDS sensor
- Arduino-based control and data processing
- Clear and easy-to-read display of salinity readings on an LCD screen

## Installation

To set up the salinity meter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the TDS sensor and LCD display to the Arduino board following the provided schematics.
3. Upload the Arduino code (`thesis_tds.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or your preferred method.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the salinity meter is properly assembled and connected.
2. Power on the Arduino board.
3. The LCD display will show the current salinity reading in parts per million (ppm).
4. Dip the TDS sensor into the liquid whose salinity you want to measure.
5. The LCD display will update with the new salinity reading.

Feel free to modify the code or schematics according to your specific requirements.
